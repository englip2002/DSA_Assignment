(1) Table Module
========================
a. Reason to choose ADT Map and the implementation of Hash Map
    - Its nature which stored key and associated value as an entry.
    - Can be used for entity classes that consist of a unique/distinct key/id, where 
      the Table class consists of table Id and the Customer class consists of customer 
      Id, which both are unique identifiers that can be treated as the “keys” of the 
      instances.
    - Since the duplication of these keys is not allowed, ADT Map is quite suitable to 
      become the collection ADT of these entity classes besides ADT List or ADT Set.

b. Display Tables Details
    - Retrieve table list from Tables.dat and display each table details including 
      table id, package served, number of seats, reserved date and table customers.
    - The table will not be reserved and no table customers if does not have reserved 
      date.
    - Display the total number of tables in table list and the total number of seats 
      reserved.

c. Add New Customer
    - Input customer details such as first name, last name, gender and date of birth

d. Create New Table

    - If reserved date has been specified, the system will force to input at least 1 
      table customer, otherwise skip the input for table customer.

e. Edit Table Details
    - Edit options:
        i.	    Package Served.

                there’s exits table customers, the new number of seats cannot less 
                than the number of table customers exits.
        iii.    Reserved Date – If change from have reserved date to no reserved date, 
                the table customers will be removed. If change from  noreserved date to 
                have reserved date, the system will force to input at least 1 table 
                customer.

f. Delete Table
    - Remove a table by selected table id from the table list.
    - Display the removed table details.

g. Visualize Seat Occupying Rate
    - Illustrate the seats occupying rates in a bar graph that shows the distributions 
      of tables based on their seats occupying rates.
    - Seat Occupying Rate = Number of Table Customers / Number of Seats * 100%
    - Seat occupying rate of each table has been categories into 10 classes, which are 
      [> 0% to 10%], [> 10% to 20%], [> 20% to 30%], [> 30% to 40%], [> 40% to 50%], 
      [> 50% to 60%], [> 60% to 70%], [> 70% to 80%], [> 80% to 90%] and [> 90% to 100%].
    - Tables with 0% of seats occupying rate will not be taken account in the bar graph.
    - The details seats occupying rates for each table in the table list will be 
      displayed in a table.
    - Will not display the graph if the table list is empty.
